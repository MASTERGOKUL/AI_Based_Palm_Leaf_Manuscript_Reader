## How to run this project 🏃
1. #### Download⬇️ the code (from the top right corner)
   
2. #### Extract the zip file📁
   
3. #### Install python 3.10 or newer 🐍<br>
   Official Python Site: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  
4. #### Install the requirements 📝✅
   1. Open command prompt(cmd/terminal)
   2. change the directory to the downloaded project
   3. install the requirements in requirements.txt <br>
   You have many options<br>
   
   #### Directly pip install in the cmd<br>
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

   (OR)

   #### Create a virtual environment in the project folder and install it (recommended)<br>
   - `python -m venv venv` - creating a virtual environment named venv<br>
   - `./venv/Scripts/activate` - to activate the virtual environment<br>
      
       NOTE: This may not allow some system to active the venv in the terminal<br>
       to overcome this run the following commands<br>
      `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process`<br>
      `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force`<br>
      now run `./venv/Scripts/activate`

   - `pip install -r requirements.txt` - install the requirements
   
6. #### Run the **app.py** file 🏃‍♀️<br>
